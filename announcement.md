Hey everyone!

CWL is applying to be a mentor organisation in the first ever Google Season of Docs (GSoD). GSoD’s philosophy is to attract as many technical writers to the open source community as possible. GSoC (Google Summer of Code) has brought plenty of code and coders to the open source community over the years while documentation is often placed at a lower importance position. We think that participating in GSoD and bringing in technical writers to furnish documentation and guides will make CWL more user friendly and easier to get started with.

We are looking for mentors and volunteers to help guide applicants and participants. If you want to propose a project or interested in mentoring participants, please go to this [repo](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/GSoD-proposals-2019) to add new project descriptions. Mentors should also register via this [form](https://forms.gle/a1x26WQGzURLerv66) as soon as possible.

Current ideas include:
 - Documentation for more background info about workflow management system in scientific data processing use, critical analysis of cwl’s development and usage. Then adapt into an open access paper.
 - Furnish general documentation
 - Expand the user guide
 - Comb through BioStar and adapt hot/high view questions into a faq/user guide
 - Documentation of other projects in the ecosystem

Feel free to expand upon those ideas and create a proposal in the proposal repo (if it’s not there already).

Thanks for your support :)
