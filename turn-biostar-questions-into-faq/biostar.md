# Turn biostar questions into faqs
Contact: Tony (tony at tony.tc)

## Project description
[BioStar](https://www.biostars.org/t/cwl/) is CWL's main point of contact for support and questions. However, many questions are in discussion style and can be hard to distill the answer quickly. Also, on a biology focused platform means users from other disciplines are excluded.  
  
We want to turn the highly viewed questions on BioStar into a FAQ page on CWL's website. The writer is requried to go through those highly viewed questions and distill and condense the answers into a succinct FAQ page.
