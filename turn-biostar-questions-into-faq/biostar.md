# Turn biostars questions into faqs
Contact: Tony Yang and Kaushik Ghose ([email](mailto:common-workflow-language-gsod-2019@googlegroups.com))

## Project description
[Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/t/cwl/) is CWL's main point of contact for support and questions. However, many questions are in discussion style and can be hard to distill the answer quickly. Also, on a biology focused platform means users from other disciplines are excluded.  
  
We want to turn the highly viewed questions on Biostars into a FAQ page on CWL's website. The writer is requried to go through those highly viewed questions and distill and condense the answers into a succinct FAQ page with code snippets. 

## Project length
